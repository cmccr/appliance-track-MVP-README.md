Capstone Idea (ApplianceTrack)

- My app is set to be a tracker app that helps home owners/property management companies. My goal is to help keep track of different homes and different appliances/household items that may need repairs, and which homes they may be in(if home owner/prop management has multiple homes). This can help keep track of makes, models, specific parts, and recommended maintenance time periods. 


MVP for Specs Capstone

Users can log into accounts.
Users can add additional users.
Users can add different properties.
Users can add different appliances(dishwasher, water softener etc.)
Users can add maintainence plans.
Users can keep track of manufacturers for repairs/parts, know which filters/lightbulbs are needed etc, and get reminders when it’s time to do maintainence.


FUTURE FEATURES

- My father in law and I are set to partner on this and are excited to brainstorm. We want to add:
    - A Barcode scanner to help expedite the information input process.
    - More to come…
